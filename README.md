# Fancy Buttons

Following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmKyG3NBY_k&t=0s&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbl1AfjiGyYxwpdAPi5v-1OU&index=2 tutorial to learn some CSS 😉 😁

# Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/karuppiah7890/fancy-buttons.git
```

2. Install a web server to serve these files. I am using [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) for this

```
$ npm i -g serve
```

and then run you web server to serve the files, in my case for `serve`, it would just be to run `serve` inside the git repo and it would look like this :

```
$ serve

   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                                    │
   │   Serving!                                         │
   │                                                    │
   │   - Local:            http://localhost:5000        │
   │   - On Your Network:  http://192.168.225.40:5000   │
   │                                                    │
   │   Copied local address to clipboard!               │
   │                                                    │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

and if you head to the browser and in the url bar paste with Cmd/Ctrl + V, you should be able to see the site 😁
